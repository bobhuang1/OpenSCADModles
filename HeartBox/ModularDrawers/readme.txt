Summary
As great as my HIVE - Stackable Hex Drawers are, they don't hold a whole lot in the drawers and the complex printing movements add a lot of time. I tried to fix this with my Modular Drawers. But these modules did not interlock. This is the interlocking version of my Modular Drawers 1.0
Modular Drawers 2.0 offers a sleek design free of complex print movements, decreasing print time while increasing storage volume. The dimensions are: 85 mm x 85 mm x 100 mm providing more than enough space to hold screws, capacitors, and other common small components.

Print Settings
Printer: 
Ender 2

Rafts: 
No

Supports: 
No

Resolution: 
200-400

Infill: 
0-5%


Notes: 
The drawers should fit inside the modules as is. It doesn't hurt to scale the modules to 101% and drawers remain at 100% (or drawers to 99% and modules 100%)
Print speed can be increased
Lower resolutions will print faster but may affect fit between slots and rails. If you have a problem with fit at lower res please tell me and I will upload a low res high speed module
I recommend printing with 5% infill
Combing cuts the time in half
